# New Jersey-Air-Quality-Prediction
Over the past decade, an increasing interest has evolved by the public in the day–to–day air quality conditions to which they are exposed. Driven by the increasing awareness of the health aspects of air pollution exposure, especially by most sensitive sub–populations such as children and the elderly, short–term air pollution forecasts are being provided more and more by local authorities. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a number used by governmental agencies to characterize the quality of the air at a given location. AQI is used for local and regional air quality management in many metropolitan cities of the world. The main objective of the present study is to forecast short–term daily AQI through previous day’s AQI and meteorological variables using principal component regression (PCR) technique.
